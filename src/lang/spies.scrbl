@title[#:tag "s:spies"]{Spies}

Spies are used for convenient display of values for print-style debugging. See
@secref["s:spies:rationale"] for why this is particularly useful in Pyret.

@section{Examples}

The shortest use of a @tt{spy} statement is to print the value of a name:

@pyret-block{
x = 10
spy: x end
}

This will produce a message like:

@margin-note{The filename will be the name of the file containing the @tt{spy}
statement, not @tt{spies.arr} as shown here}
@verbatim{
Spying (at file:///spies.arr:2:0-2:10)
  x: 10
}

On code.pyret.org, you'll see output like:

@image[#:scale 0.3 "src/lang/simple-spy.png"]

Both of these outputs indicate that the name was @tt{x} and the value was
@tt{10}. In the text output, the line and column information is printed (this
happened at line 2). In the visual output, the @tt{x} is underlined â€“ clicking
it will scroll the editor to the line of the spy statement and highlight the
corresponding use of @tt{x}.

A @tt{spy} statement can contain more than one name, and will print out all their
values:

@pyret-block{
x = 10
y = [list: 1, 2, 3]
spy: x, y end
}

@verbatim{
Spying (at file:///spies.arr:3:0-3:13)
  x: 10
  y: [list: 1, 2, 3]
}


A spy statement can also contain a message. This can be helpful for
distinguishing between spy statements without looking at their corresponding
line numbers:

@pyret-block{
fun square(x):
  spy "in square": x end
  x * x
end

fun cube(x):
  spy "in cube": x end
  x * x * x
end

square(x)
cube(x)
square(x)
}

Will produce:

@verbatim{
Spying "in square" (at file:///spies.arr:2:2-2:24)
  x: 3
Spying "in cube" (at file:///spies.arr:7:2-7:22)
  x: 2
Spying "in square" (at file:///spies.arr:2:2-2:24)
  x: 2
}


If we want to @tt{spy} on an expression, rather than just names, we can give
the expression a name within the @tt{spy} statement:

@pyret-block{
fun reverse(lst, sofar):
  spy "lengths":
    lst-length: lst.length(),
    sofar-length: sofar.length(),
    sum: lst.length() + sofar.length()
  end
  cases(List<A>) lst:
    | empty => sofar
    | link(first, rest) =>
      reverse(rest, link(first, sofar))
  end
end

check:
  reverse([list: "a", "b", "c"], empty) is [list: "c", "b", "a"]
end

}

This produces:

@verbatim{
Spying "lengths" (at file:///spies.arr:2:2-6:5)
  lst-length: 3
  sofar-length: 0
  sum: 3
Spying "lengths" (at file://spies.arr:2:2-6:5)
  lst-length: 2
  sofar-length: 1
  sum: 3
Spying "lengths" (at file:///spies.arr:2:2-6:5)
  lst-length: 1
  sofar-length: 2
  sum: 3
Spying "lengths" (at file:///spies.arr:2:2-6:5)
  lst-length: 0
  sofar-length: 3
  sum: 3
}


@section{Grammar}

The grammar of @tt{spy} statements is:

@bnf['Pyret]{
SPY: "spy"
END: "end"
COLON: ":"
COMMA: ","
spy-stmt: SPY [expr] COLON spy-body END
spy-body: spy-field [COMMA spy-field]*
spy-field: NAME | NAME COLON binop-expr
}



@section[#:tag "s:spies:rationale"]{Rationale}

Often, when debugging or explaining a program, it's useful to display values
during execution. It's common to do this with functions like @pyret-id["print"
"<global>"]. However, both in general, and specifically in Pyret, using a
regular function call for debug printing leaves something to be desired. For
example, just printing doesn't track the line and column something was printed
at, and when the value of an identifier is printed, its name is lost in the
ouput, forcing the programmer to add extra string output describing the value.
More annoyingly in Pyret, since we often add print statements to
already-existing code, it becomes a nuisance to add @secref["s:blocky-blocks"]
just to get a debugging print.

Spies give the compiler the necessary information to print out source
locations, track static information like names, and know that the @tt{spy}
statement is allowed on its own line, and doesn't require adding @tt{block:}
declarations.
